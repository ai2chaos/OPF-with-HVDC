      In power system analysis and calculation, there need network structures and parameters of various. Sometimes, it takes too much
time and efforts to find and arrange the needed data. Here we have collected and arranged the parameters often used in our work. Through internet you may download it. We hope it would be helpful for your research work.
      Here data are provided in four different formats, i.e. TH format, BPA format, EUROSTAG format, IEEE format. 
      File 'TH_format' gives brief introduct about TH format. For EUROSTAG format, please refer to the EUROSTAG package's manual. IEEE format is explained in [1] "Common Format for Exchange of Solved Load Flow Data", IEEE TRANS on PAS, Vol-92, No.6, Nov./Dec., 1973, pp. 1916-1925. While for BPA format, refer "BPA package 2.0 user's manual" (in Chinese). 
      For now, mainly power flow data of some typical system are provided, including two parts : power flow data and power flow solution. If possible, we also present system diagrams. It is also provided about the sources based on which the data is prepared. 
The name of folder shows the system bus number and the format, such as 011th implies 11-bus system in TH format. The filename extension expresses the corresponding content: ".dat" extension by is the LF data, ".res" the LF results, ".mac" the some dynamic data for transient stability analysis. All the data files are stored in text style. The figures are included in the "readme" files. 
      We will extend and maintain database from time to time. If you found any errors in the data, please feel free to contact with us. Besides, your additional data and suggestions are welcomed, which will help us to make the database more informative. 
      The aim of the work is for the conveniences of researchers. The data can NOT be used for any business activity. Otherwise the user will be responsible for any consequence.
      Many ones have joined the work, including Lei SHI, Guangming LI, Wei ZHANG, Shaofeng ZHANG, etc. We hope more people take cares about the work to make it better.

Best regards,
